The game features a grid with many squares.
Each square equals one point.
The square in the lower left is worth 150 extra points.
The game ends when you have selected all the squares.
Whoever has selected LESS squares wins.
In one game there can be up to 4 players.
The players are identified by color.
Below the grid you can see who is going to play next.

The yellow square indicates the position of the pointer of the player.
The white squares to the top and to the right from where you touch gets colored.
In this modality, each player is free to make the preferred move, with no restrictions.
