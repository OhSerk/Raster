This game is born as an experiment, it's the first game I ever made. <3

#Precompiled Processing libraries
Unfortunately Processing provides precompiled library required for this project:
* `processing-core.jar` − [processing/wiki/Build-Instructions](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions)
* `apwidgets.jar` − [I dunno how to compile it actually](https://code.google.com/archive/p/apwidgets/source/default/source)

...and unfortunately it seems that Processing requires Oracle's JRE instead of the OpenJDK to compile the `processing-core.jar`. I'm following this bug report:
